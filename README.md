# Diabetic Prediction

This GitHub repository contains code and resources for predicting diabetes using machine learning algorithms. The project utilizes the PIMA dataset and provides a streamlined way to run the prediction on Streamlit.

## Instructions

To run this project on Streamlit, follow the steps below:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/prakash02100/Diabetic_Prediction.git
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the Streamlit app:
   ```
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

4. The application will open in your default web browser, allowing you to interact with the prediction model.

## Project Structure

- `app.py`: Contains the Streamlit application code for user interaction and displaying the prediction results.
- `data`: Directory containing the PIMA dataset or any additional data files required for the prediction.
- `models`: Directory to store trained machine learning models.
- `utils.py`: Utility functions and helper code used in the project.

## Requirements

The following are the key requirements for running this project:

- Python 3.7+
- Streamlit
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn

You can install these dependencies by running the command mentioned in step 2 of the Instructions section.
